Hey Fan,

It is 11:54 pm local on 9 SEP 21. You are about to dive into your first project
for the NEW Foundations course on TOP. Best of luck applying your knowledge. You
will be building a basic recipe website. 

10 SEP 21

- Finished the recipe project from TOP. I learned how to fill out the HTML
boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs,
images, and links. Alongside, I was able to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes.
Most importantly, I was able to organize "beginner friendly" clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer.

- GIT GIT GIT. Making it a habit to commit early, often, and descriptive is a skill I do need to brush on, but will practice I know I will be able to improve.

Please do share any tips and tricks on my project.
