<h2>Light chewy bagels that will fill your taste buds!</h2>

    <p>
        The bialy is not a sub-type of bagel, it’s a thing unto itself. Round with a depressed middle filled with cooked onions and sometimes poppy seeds, it is simply baked (bagels are boiled, then baked). 
        This means its outside is matte, not shiny, and it doesn’t have that pull-away crust. Large puffy bubbles characterize the bialy’s innards. 
        Though it can be slathered with butter or cream cheese (and topped with cured/smoked fish), purists prefer them straight up, preferably no more than five hours after being pulled from the oven.

        A traditional bialy has a diameter of up to 15 centimetres (5.9 in) and is a chewy yeast roll similar to a bagel. 
        Unlike a bagel, which is boiled before baking, a bialy is simply baked, and instead of a hole in the middle it has a depression. 
        Before baking, this depression is filled with diced onions and other ingredients, possibly including garlic, poppy seeds, or bread crumbs.
